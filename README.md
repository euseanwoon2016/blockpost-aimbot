# Simple Blockpost Aimbot

An aimbot I made for the game "Blockpost" written in C++ some time ago. I forgot when but I stopped working on it and I thought I would upload it to Github for future reference.

## Features

1. Right-click to lock on to head.

Thats pretty much it. I wanted to add some visuals and a traceline function but I couldn't and gave up on it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
